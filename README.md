Web scraping is the process of using computer programs to automatically collect data from web pages. In particular, when applied to the Department of Medical Services, a government agency under the Ministry of Public Health of Thailand, web scraping can be a powerful tool. It allows users—such as researchers, data analysts, or other organizations—to systematically and efficiently access important information available on the department's website.
